# Fine Tuning LLM for Sleep Stage Classification
Sleep consists of distinct stages: Wake (Stage 0), Light Sleep (NREM1 - Stage 1), Deep Sleep (NREM2 and NREM3 - Stages 2 and 3), and REM (Stage 4). Each stage is essential for learning, memory, and overall health. Using EEG signals recorded in 30-second intervals, the goal is to classify these stages accurately based on brain activity patterns.
